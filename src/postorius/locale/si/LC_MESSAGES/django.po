"message, it is not stripped. Setting this value to either Reply to List, "
"Explicit Reply, or Reply Only causes Mailman to insert a specific Reply-To: "
"header in all messages, overriding the header in the original message if "
"necessary (Explicit Reply inserts the value of reply_to_address). Explicit "
"Reply-to set; no Cc added is useful forannounce-only lists where you want to "
"avoid someone replying to the list address. There are many reasons not to "
"introduce or override the Reply-To: header. One is that some posters depend "

"Another is that modifying Reply-To: makes it much more difficult to send "
"private replies. See <a href=\"http://marc.merlins.org/netrants/reply-to-"

"dissenting opinion. Some mailing lists have restricted posting privileges, "
"with a parallel list devoted to discussions. Examples are `patches' or "
"`checkin' lists, where software changes are posted by a revision control "
"system, but discussion about the changes occurs on a developers mailing "
"list. To support these types of mailing lists, select Explicit Reply and set "
